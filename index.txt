Food Label Nutrition Extractor	People want to know calories, sugar, allergens	OCR reads nutrition labels; displays calories, sugar, etc.	Health awareness, helps diabetics / allergy sufferers 

✅ Conclusion (for a data science / ML person):
👉 Food Label Nutrition Extractor is a much better fit:

After OCR, you get structured data (calories, sugar, fat, allergens).

You can store user scans → create a dataset.

You can do:

EDA (exploratory data analysis) on personal or public nutrition habits.

Dashboards: daily/weekly intake.

Forecasting / time series: predict future trends.

Clustering: group food by risk (e.g., high sugar).

Recommendation system: suggest lower-calorie alternatives.

Add NLP to detect ingredient lists and highlight allergens.

This makes it a true ML + data science project, not just OCR.


🌱 And it aligns beautifully with your field:
📸 Computer Vision → detect / crop nutrition label.

🧠 OCR (deep learning) → extract text.

📝 NLP → parse text into structured nutrients.

📊 Data Science → visualize trends, clustering, forecasting.

🤖 Recommendation → healthier choices. 


✅ Voice summary: “This pack has 25g sugar, above your daily target.”
✅ Weekly sugar intake chart.
✅ “Scan again?” history & search.
✅ Recommend similar lower-calorie products.
✅ Alert if allergen (e.g., "contains peanuts").
